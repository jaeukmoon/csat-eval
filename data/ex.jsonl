The problem says that the function y = f(x) is the inverse of the function y = a^x, where a is greater than 0 and not equal to 1. Then it tells me that f(4) = 2, and I need to find f(x). Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the inverse function of an exponential function is the logarithm. So, if y = a^x, then the inverse function f(x) should be log base a of x, right? Because inverse functions essentially switch the x and y. So starting with y = a^x, if I solve for x, I get x = log_a(y), which means the inverse function is f(x) = log_a(x).\n\nBut they also give me a specific point: f(4) = 2. That should help me find the value of a. Let me plug that into the inverse function. If f(4) = 2, then log_a(4) = 2. Now, I need to solve for a.\n\nRemember that log_a(4) = 2 means that a^2 = 4. So, solving for a, we take the square root of both sides. So a = sqrt(4) = 2. But wait, since a > 0 and a ≠ 1, 2 is a valid value here. So that would mean that a is 2. Therefore, the inverse function f(x) is log base 2 of x.\n\nLet me check that again. If the original function is y = 2^x, then its inverse should be y = log2(x). Then, plugging in x=4 into the inverse function, f(4) = log2(4) = 2, which matches the given condition. That seems right.\n\nBut let me verify all steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything. The problem says f is the inverse of y = a^x, so f(x) must be log_a(x). Then, using the point (4, 2) which lies on f(x), substituting into log_a(4) = 2, which leads to a^2 = 4, so a = 2. Since a must be positive and not 1, 2 is acceptable. So, f(x) = log2(x). Therefore, the answer should be log base 2 of x, which can be written as log_2(x), or in boxed form as \\boxed{\\log_2 x}.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just make sure there isn't another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, since inverse functions switch x and y, if f is the inverse of a^x, then f(a^x) = x and a^{f(x)} = x. So, using f(4) = 2, then a^{2} = 4, again leading to a = 2. So same result. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think that's solid. The answer is log base 2 of x.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe inverse function is \\boxed{\\log_2 x}.\n</think>\n\nThe function \\( y = f(x) \\) is the inverse of the function \\( y = a^x \\).
