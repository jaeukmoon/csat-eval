Over the last few semesters, there have been requests for more diverse school clubs. For this reason, the school decided to expand the number of clubs for extracurricular activities. This provides students with an opportunity to make additional clubs. Students can make any type of club based on their various interests, such as hip-hop, K-pop dancing, or coding. Therefore, I am encouraging you to submit a proposal for a new club that you would like to create. Please turn this in to my office by the end of this week. I look forward to seeing your great ideas.\nBest regards,\nAmanda Clark\n\n\\begin{itemize} \\item[1] 동아리 활동에 대한 만족도를 조사하려고 \\item[2] 동아리 개설 제안서를 공개하려고 \\item[3] 체험 활동 결과 보고서를 요청하려고 \\item[4] 동아리 신규 회원 모집을 공지하려고 \\item[5] 방과 후 활동 프로그램을 설명하려고 \\end{itemize}", "answer": 2, "score": 2, "review": null}

She walked the narrow streets of the village, unsure about which way to go. Suddenly, Sophie saw a familiar sight. “Yes, this must be it,” she thought. In front of her was a wall with flowers painted on it. Although the colors were now faded, the familiar shapes on the wall were the same ones she had painted with her father as a child. Sophie nodded, smiled brightly, and walked toward the gate.

As work becomes ever more modularised, commoditised and standardised, and as markets for digital work are created, ties between service work and particular places can be disconnected. While the business process of outsourcing that emerged in the 1990s allowed large companies to take advantage of a ‘global reserve army’ by moving their call centres to cheap and distant labour markets, cloudwork changes the volume and granularity at which geographically non-proximate work can take place. A small business in New York can hire a freelance transcriber in Nairobi one day and a New Delhi the next. No offices or factories need to be built, no local regulations are observed, and — in most cases — no local taxes are paid.

Coopetition is defined as “the simultaneous pursuit of cooperation and competition among firms to leverage strategically important resources for superior value creation purposes”. It is a useful way to understand the dynamic nature of sport businesses which need to collaborate for resource efficiency purposes but potentially compete with each other. This special relationship should be managed properly due to trust and confidence issues being paramount. It can be challenging to be collaborative and competitive in sport as they involve different forms of behaviour. This means a careful balancing act may be required in terms of the amount of emphasis placed on each activity. Often sport managers will try to be more competitive due to performance reasons and less collaborative. By necessity they may need to share information but do so in a cautious manner.
